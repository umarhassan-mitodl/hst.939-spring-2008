Reflection Papers
-----------------

Three short reflection piece (1 - 2 pages **maximum**). The purpose of the reflection piece is to help you organize your thoughts and clarify questions prior to a guest lecture. It is not supposed to be a "paper" or point by point, article by article recounting of any set of readings. Instead, it should summarize:

1.  What struck you most about a particular reading or lecturer, what you agree and disagree with, and why?
2.  How the readings or lecturers have impacted your thoughts on a particular area of interest in health care and technology.

Oral Presentation
-----------------

The oral presentation and the written final report will be reviewed by the course director, co-directors, tutors/supervisors, and lecturers. These group-based assessments will be combined with an individual assessment to determine the final grade.
